This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com)
Broadly speaking for the combat the player has a group of 4 characters to control, and a group of 
enemies controlled by the computer, the maximum number of enemies can be chosen by the user.

*The Thief class can equip, Swords, Knives and Bows.

We have a lot of possible Classes for playable characters each of them has a list of permitted 
weapons that can equip and if they are Mages they have mana to cast spells. In this model
the enemy are characters too, but they cannot equip weapons of any kind.

The turns are calculated in base of the weight of the characters, enemies have their own weight and
playable character's weight is given by the weapon they have equipped. 

To run the alpha you need to execute the FinalReality, class, a window will open where you are able to insert
characters, weapons, equip the created weapons to available characters, and select how many enemies you want to fight,
you can add till a maximum of 5 player characters.

The available weapon types are "Espada", "Arco", "Hacha", "Baston" and "Cuchillo".

The available character classes are "Caballero", "Ladron", "Ingeniero", "Mago Blanco" and "Mago Blanco", each 
class has unique atributes and it's up to you to discover them, also each class can only be equiped with certain 
weapon types:

 Caballero: Espada, Hacha, Cuchillo
 Ingeniero: Hacha, Arco
 Ladron: Espada, Cuchillo, Arco
 M. Negro: Cuchillo, Baston
 M. Blanco: Baston


To start a battle is needed that the Player's Characters have equipped weapon, to start the turns system

Then you will be able to attack or change the equipment of your characters by turns (The weapon must be created
previously), to equip and attack is only needed to enter the name of the weapon or the name of the enemy.

The game will automaticaly detect if you win or loose and you will be able to start a new battle, starting in the 
configuration scene.
