This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com)
Broadly speaking for the combat the player has a group of 4 characters to control, and a group of 
enemies controlled by the computer, the maximum number of enemies can be chosen by the user.

*The Thief class can equip, Swords, Knives and Bows.

We have a lot of possible Classes for playable characters each of them has a list of permitted 
weapons that can equip and if they are Mages they have mana to cast spells. In this model
the enemy are characters too, but they cannot equip weapons of any kind.

The turns are calculated in base of the weight of the characters, enemies have their own weight and
playable character's weight is given by the weapon they have equipped. 

To start a battle is needed that the Player's Characters have equipped weapon, to start the turns system
